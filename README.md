<b>Learning reactjs:</b>

Simple app to get and list recipes from an external api.

<b>New things:</b>

useEffect: make the request onload of the page (or when its called)
useState: get variables and save it on state
css module: specify a css file (ex: recipe.module.css), this gonna load only to a specific file (should be imported)

<b>External API:</b>
https://api.edamam.com/search?q=${query}&app_id=${APP_ID}&app_key=${APP_KEY}

-> need to register and get a key and id. (using free mode)
